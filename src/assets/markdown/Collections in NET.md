# Collections in .NET

Created: June 24, 2022 6:04 PM

##### The different type of data structure available in C# are:

1. **List**: The **`List<T>`** class is a dynamic array that can hold elements of a specific type **`T`**. It allows for dynamic sizing, insertion, deletion, and access by index.
2. **Array**: Arrays are fixed-size collections that store elements of the same type. The size of an array is determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.
3. **Dictionary**: The **`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`** class stores key-value pairs. It provides fast access to values based on their associated keys.
4. **Hash Set**: A **`HashSet<T>`** is an unordered collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicate values.
5. **Queue**: The **`Queue<T>`** class is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) collection. It is often used for tasks like processing items in the order they were added.
6. **Stack**: The **`Stack<T>`** class is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. It is often used for tasks like implementing undo functionality.
7. **Linked List**: The **`LinkedList<T>`** class provides a doubly linked list implementation, which allows for efficient insertions and removals at both ends.
8. **Array List**: The **`ArrayList`** is a legacy collection that is not type-safe. It can store elements of different types, but it's generally not recommended for modern C# development. Consider using **`List<T>`** instead.
9. **Sorted Set**: The **`SortedSet<T>`** class is a set collection with elements sorted in ascending order.
10. **Sorted Dictionary**: The **`SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`** is a dictionary where the keys are sorted in ascending order.
11. **Bit Array**: The **`BitArray`** is a collection that stores a series of Boolean values as bits.
12. **Concurrent Collections**: These are thread-safe collection classes that allow safe concurrent access from multiple threads. Examples include **`ConcurrentQueue`**, **`ConcurrentDictionary`**, and **`ConcurrentBag`**.
13. **Immutable Collections**: Immutable collections cannot be modified after they are created. They provide safe sharing of data across threads. Examples include **`ImmutableList`**, **`ImmutableDictionary`**, and **`ImmutableStack`**.
14. **Custom Collections**: You can create custom collection types by implementing the **`ICollection<T>`**, **`IList<T>`**, or other collection interfaces, or by extending existing collection classes.
15. **Read Only Collections**: The **`ReadOnlyCollection<T>`** class allows you to create a read-only wrapper around an existing collection, preventing modification of the original collection.
16. **Keyed Collections**: Some collections, like **`KeyedCollection<TKey, TItem>`**, are designed for scenarios where elements have a unique key associated with them.

#### General.

##### ****Explain the differences and use cases between IEnumerable, ICollection, and IList interfaces in C# Collections.****

**Summary**

- **`IEnumerable`** is the simplest and provides read-only iteration.
- **`ICollection`** adds basic modification capabilities.
- **`IList`** further extends **`ICollection`** by providing indexed access and more advanced modification methods.

Brief

1. **IEnumerable**:
    - **`IEnumerable`** is the most basic of the three interfaces.
    - It represents a forward-only cursor of items and provides a way to iterate over a collection of objects.
    - It defines a single method, **`GetEnumerator()`**, which returns an **`IEnumerator`** interface that allows you to traverse the collection using **`foreach`** or LINQ queries.
    - **`IEnumerable`** is read-only, meaning you can only iterate over the items but not modify the collection.
    - It doesn't provide any methods for adding, removing, or modifying elements within the collection.
2. **ICollection**:
    - **`ICollection`** extends **`IEnumerable`**, adding more features.
    - It represents a collection of objects with methods for adding, removing, and checking for the existence of elements.
    - **`ICollection`** includes methods like **`Add`**, **`Remove`**, **`Contains`**, and **`CopyTo`**, which allow you to modify and manipulate the collection.
    - It also provides properties such as **`Count`** to get the number of elements in the collection and **`IsReadOnly`** to check if the collection is read-only.
    - **`ICollection`** is suitable for collections where you need to perform basic modifications.
3. **IList**:
    - **`IList`** extends **`ICollection`**, providing even more functionality.
    - It represents a list of objects, where each element has a specific index.
    - **`IList`** includes methods and properties for adding, removing, and modifying elements at specific positions within the list.
    - You can access elements by their index using the **`this[int]`** property.
    - **`IList`** also includes methods like **`Insert`**, **`RemoveAt`**, and **`IndexOf`** for working with the list by index.
    - **`IList`** is suitable when you need to work with ordered collections where you need to manage elements by their positions.

##### ****What are the advantages of using a System.Collections.Concurrent namespace over the regular System.Collections.Generic namespace for collections, especially in multithreading scenarios?****

**`System.Collections.Concurrent`** and **`System.Collections.Generic`** are two different namespaces in the .NET Framework that provide collections for managing data in a multi-threaded environment, but they have different purposes and characteristics:

1. **System.Collections.Concurrent**:
    - The **`System.Collections.Concurrent`** namespace contains collections designed for safe, efficient multi-threaded access. These collections are suitable for scenarios where multiple threads need to access and modify the collection concurrently.
    - Collections in this namespace include **`ConcurrentDictionary`**, **`ConcurrentQueue`**, and **`ConcurrentStack`**, among others.
    - These collections provide built-in thread safety mechanisms, such as fine-grained locking or lock-free algorithms, to allow concurrent access without explicit locking by the programmer.
    - They are well-suited for scenarios where you want to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions when multiple threads read from, write to, or modify the collection simultaneously.
2. **System.Collections.Generic**:
    - The **`System.Collections.Generic`** namespace contains the standard .NET collection classes that are not thread-safe by default.
    - Collections in this namespace include **`List<T>`**, **`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`**, **`Queue<T>`**, and **`Stack<T`**, among others.
    - These collections are not designed for concurrent access. If you need to work with them in a multi-threaded environment, you must take care of synchronization yourself, using locks, monitors, or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
    - They are suitable for single-threaded scenarios or situations where you have explicit control over synchronization.

##### Can you create an IEnumerable that generates an infinite sequence of values on-the-fly without causing a memory leak? 
How would you implement such a collection?

Here’s an example of an infinite `IEnumerable<int>` that generates increasing integer values starting from a given value:

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<int> InfiniteGenerator(int startValue)
{
    int currentValue = startValue;
    while (true)
    {
        yield return currentValue;
        currentValue++;
    }
}

// Usage:
foreach (var value in InfiniteGenerator(5))
{
// This loop will run indefinitely, generating increasing integer values starting from 5// Note: Add a break condition to avoid an infinite loop.
}
```

The **`yield`** keyword is typically used in iterator methods, which are methods that return an **`IEnumerable`** or **`IEnumerator`** object. These methods use the **`yield`** keyword to specify which values should be included in the sequence and when they should be produced.

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
{
    yield return 1;
    yield return 2;
    yield return 3;
    yield return 4;
    yield return 5;
}

// Usage
foreach (var number in GetNumbers())
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

Here are the primary use cases for the **`yield`** keyword in the context of collections:

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Iterator methods with **`yield`** provide lazy evaluation. This means that the elements in the collection are generated only when they are requested by the consumer. It allows you to work with potentially infinite or very large collections without consuming excessive memory.
2. **On-the-Fly Generation**: **`yield`** allows you to generate elements one at a time, making it useful for scenarios where you want to create a sequence dynamically, such as reading from a file, database, or other external source.
3. **Simplified Code**: Using **`yield`** simplifies the code for creating collections. It eliminates the need to manually manage collection state and provides a more readable and concise way to define iterator methods.

#### Array, ArrayList, LinkedList.

##### ****In C# Collections, how does the performance of a List compare to a LinkedList when it comes to insertion and deletion operations in the middle of the collection? Explain why.****

![Untitled](/assets/img/linked_list_vs_arry.png)

When it comes to insertion and deletion operations in the middle of the collection, `LinkedList<T>` usually has better performance than `List<T>`. The performance difference arises because of the way both these collections are organized internally:

- `List<T>` is based on an underlying array. When inserting or deleting elements in the middle, the elements after the insertion/deletion point have to be moved to maintain a continuous array, resulting in an `O(n)` time complexity.
- `LinkedList<T>`, on the other hand, is a doubly-linked list. Insertion and deletion only require reassigning pointers. Though searching an element in a linked list is O(n), once the targeted element is found, insertion and deletion are O(1).

Therefore, if you need to frequently insert or delete elements in the middle of a collection, `LinkedList<T>` is more suitable from a performance perspective.

However if the operation needed is iteration then ArrayList is better than LinkedList. It is because ArrayList supports random access through indexing. 
Also there is no need for extra memory to store the reference key.

##### **Discuss the performance differences between Array, ArrayList, and List when it comes to adding, deleting, inserting, and looping through elements in C# Collections. with example**

**Short Comparison**

**Array**: Arrays are fixed-size and strongly-typed collections. As a result, the performance of arrays when accessing elements is very efficient (O(1)), as no boxing or unboxing is required.

- Adding an element: Not directly supported. Requires manual array resizing, resulting in O(n) complexity.
- Deleting an element: Not directly supported. Requires shifting elements and manual resizing, resulting in O(n) complexity.
- Inserting an element: Not directly supported. Requires shifting elements and manual resizing, resulting in O(n) complexity.
- Looping through elements: Very efficient (O(n)) due to strong-typing and continuous memory allocation, which benefits CPU cache locality.

**ArrayList**: ArrayList is a dynamic-size collection that stores elements as `object` types, leading to boxing and unboxing overhead when working with value types.

- Adding an element: Amortized O(1) complexity. —> adding at the end.
- Deleting an element: O(n) complexity, as it requires shifting elements.
- Inserting an element: O(n) complexity, as it requires shifting elements.
- Looping through elements: O(n) complexity, with potential additional overhead from boxing and unboxing when accessing elements.

**List**: List is a dynamic-size and strongly-typed collection, which provides better performance than ArrayList, particularly when dealing with value types.

- Adding an element: Amortized O(1) complexity.
- Deleting an element: O(n) complexity, as it requires shifting elements.
- Inserting an element: O(n) complexity, as it requires shifting elements.
- Looping through elements: O(n) complexity, with efficient element access due to strong-typing and no need for boxing and unboxing.

In general, for most scenarios, `List<T>` is preferred over `ArrayList` due to its strongly-typed nature and better performance with value types. Arrays are best suited for scenarios where the collection size is fixed or known in advance, and memory usage and element access performance are crucial.

**Explanation with code**

Arrays, **`ArrayList`**, and **`List`** in C# have different performance characteristics when it comes to adding, deleting, inserting, and looping through elements. These differences are due to the underlying data structures and how they manage memory. Let's discuss the performance differences with examples:

1. **Arrays**:
    - Arrays have a fixed size, so adding or removing elements can be inefficient because it often requires creating a new array with the updated size.
    - Arrays are efficient for direct element access and iteration.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    csharpCopy code
    int[] array = new int[3] { 1, 2, 3 };
    // Adding an element requires creating a new array.
    int[] newArray = new int[array.Length + 1];
    Array.Copy(array, newArray, array.Length);
    newArray[array.Length] = 4;
    array = newArray;
    
    ```
    
2. **ArrayList**:
    - **`ArrayList`** is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as needed. However, it stores objects, so there's boxing/unboxing overhead for value types.
    - Adding or removing elements can be relatively slow compared to **`List<T>`**.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    csharpCopy code
    ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
    arrayList.Add(1);
    arrayList.Add("Two");  // Boxing of integer
    arrayList.Remove("Two");
    
    ```
    
3. **List**:
    - **`List<T>`** is a generic list that is type-safe and more efficient than **`ArrayList`**. It's based on a dynamically resizable array.
    - Adding, removing, and inserting elements are generally more efficient than with arrays and **`ArrayList`**.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    csharpCopy code
    List<int> list = new List<int>();
    list.Add(1);
    list.Add(2);
    list.RemoveAt(0);
    list.Insert(1, 3);
    
    ```
    
4. **Looping through Elements**:
    - Looping through elements in an array is the most efficient because it has a simple, contiguous memory layout.
    - **`List<T>`** is also efficient for iteration as it is backed by an array.
    - **`ArrayList`** may be less efficient due to boxing/unboxing and a less predictable memory layout.
    
    Example:
    
    ```csharp
    csharpCopy code
    foreach (int item in list) { /* process item */ }
    foreach (int item in array) { /* process item */ }
    foreach (object item in arrayList) { /* process item */ }
    
    ```
    

In summary, when considering performance for adding, removing, inserting, and iterating through elements:

- Arrays are efficient for direct element access but less so for resizing.
- **`ArrayList`** is less efficient than **`List<T`**> due to boxing/unboxing and less predictable memory layout.
- **`List<T>`** is generally the most efficient for most operations due to its type-safety and resizable array structure.

For performance-critical scenarios, it's recommended to use **`List<T>`** or other specialized collection classes that match the specific requirements of your application.

#### HashSet and Dictionary.

##### **Explain the concept of a “bucket” in the context of the Dictionary class in C# Collections and how it affects the performance during hash collisions.**

In a **`Dictionary`** in C#, data is stored in key-value pairs, and each key is associated with a hash code. The primary goal of using a hash code is to efficiently locate the corresponding value in the dictionary without having to search through all elements one by one. However, hash codes are not always unique, meaning different keys can produce the same hash code. When this happens, it leads to a situation called a "hash collision."

A "bucket" in a **`Dictionary`** is a data structure designed to handle hash collisions. It's like a container that can hold multiple key-value pairs. Instead of storing key-value pairs directly at the computed index based on the hash code, the **`Dictionary`** uses the hash code to determine the appropriate bucket. Within that bucket, it uses additional information, such as the actual key's hash code or equality comparison, to find the specific key-value pair.

**Example of Bucket and Hash Collision**

Suppose you have a **`Dictionary`** in C# where you want to store key-value pairs, and you have the following keys and their associated hash codes:

```csharp
csharpCopy code
Key1 => HashCode: 123
Key2 => HashCode: 456
Key3 => HashCode: 123  // Hash collision with Key1
Key4 => HashCode: 789

```

Now, let's assume you want to add these key-value pairs to the dictionary:

```csharp
csharpCopy code
Dictionary<string, int> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();
myDictionary.Add("Key1", 100);
myDictionary.Add("Key2", 200);
myDictionary.Add("Key3", 300);
myDictionary.Add("Key4", 400);

```

1. **Bucket Creation**:
    - When you add these key-value pairs to the dictionary, the dictionary uses the hash codes to determine where to store the key-value pairs.
    - Since **`Key1`** and **`Key3`** share the same hash code (123), and **`Key2`** and **`Key4`** have different hash codes, the dictionary will create multiple buckets.
2. **Storing Key-Value Pairs in Buckets**:
    - The key-value pairs are stored in buckets based on their hash codes.
    - In our example, **`Key1`** and **`Key3`** will be stored in the same bucket, and **`Key2`** and **`Key4`** will be stored in their respective buckets.
3. **Bucket Lookup**:
    - When you want to retrieve a value associated with a key, the dictionary first calculates the hash code for the key.
    - The hash code is used to locate the appropriate bucket.
    - For example, to find the value associated with "Key3," the dictionary will use its hash code (123) to identify the bucket where it should be located.
4. **Within-Bucket Search**:
    - Within the bucket, the dictionary uses additional information, such as the actual key's hash code or equality comparison, to pinpoint the exact key-value pair you're looking for.
    - In our example, within the bucket with a hash code of 123, the dictionary uses equality comparison to determine if the key is "Key3," and once found, it returns the associated value (300).

By using buckets, the **`Dictionary`** can efficiently handle hash collisions without needing to search through all key-value pairs in the collection. This approach keeps the lookup and retrieval times close to O(1) on average, making dictionaries highly efficient for storing and retrieving data even when hash collisions occur. Buckets play a crucial role in achieving this efficiency.

##### **Difference between HashSet and Dictionary**

| HashSet | Dictionary |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose:

HashSet is designed to store a collection of unique elements (values).
It does not store key-value pairs but rather just the values themselves. | Purpose:

Dictionary is designed to store key-value pairs.
It allows you to associate a unique key with a corresponding value. |
| Usage:

HashSet is useful when you need to maintain a collection of distinct values.
It's commonly used for deduplication and checking for the existence of elements in a collection. | Usage:

Dictionary is used when you need to maintain a collection of key-value associations.
It's commonly used for creating mappings or lookups. |

```csharp
var uniqueNumbers = new HashSet<int>();
uniqueNumbers.Add(1);
uniqueNumbers.Add(2);
uniqueNumbers.Add(1); // Duplicate value, not added
uniqueNumbers.Add(3);

// The set contains {1, 2, 3}
```

```csharp
var personAges = new Dictionary<string, int>();
personAges["Alice"] = 25;
personAges["Bob"] = 30;
personAges["Alice"] = 26; // Updates the value for the key "Alice"

// The dictionary contains { "Alice" => 26, "Bob" => 30 }
```

##### ****How does the GetHashCode method affect the behavior of HashSet and Dictionary in C# Collections?****

**Summary**

- In C# collections like **`HashSet`** and **`Dictionary`**, the **`GetHashCode`** method is crucial for determining how elements are stored and retrieved efficiently within these collections.
- **HashSet**: **`GetHashCode`** generates hash codes for elements, allowing them to be distributed into "buckets" in the set. This aids in quickly adding, retrieving, and checking for the existence of elements.
- **Example**: Overriding **`GetHashCode`** in a custom class (e.g., **`Person`**) helps ensure uniqueness and efficient deduplication based on a specific property, like a person's name.
- **Dictionary**: **`GetHashCode`** calculates hash codes for keys, facilitating the location of key-value pairs in the dictionary's internal structure. This ensures fast key-based access.
- **Example**: The well-implemented **`GetHashCode`** method for string keys in a **`Dictionary`** is essential for the quick retrieval of associated values.

The default `GetHashCode` implementation for reference types in C# is based on object identity, which means that two different instances of the same class are considered unequal even if their property values are identical. In other words, each distinct object gets a unique hash code by default, regardless of its content.

To clarify, let's use your `Person` class example:

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

```

Suppose you create two different instances of the `Person` class with identical property values:

```csharp
var person1 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 };
var person2 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 25 };

```

Although `person1` and `person2` have the same property values ("Alice" and 25), they are considered two distinct objects in memory. When you calculate their hash codes using the default `GetHashCode` method (inherited from the `object` class), they will have different hash codes. Here's a simplified example of how this default behavior works:

```csharp
int hash1 = person1.GetHashCode();  // Computes a unique hash code for person1
int hash2 = person2.GetHashCode();  // Computes a unique hash code for person2

```

In this case, `hash1` and `hash2` will not be equal, despite `person1` and `person2` having the same property values. This default behavior can be problematic when you want to use instances of a class as keys in a collection like a `HashSet` or a `Dictionary` because, by default, they won't be considered equal.

To make these instances equal for collection purposes, you need to override the `GetHashCode` and `Equals` methods in your custom class (as shown in the previous response). By customizing these methods, you can ensure that objects with the same property values are treated as equal, which is essential for correctly using these objects as keys in collections.

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Name.GetHashCode();
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (obj is Person other)
        {
            return Name == other.Name;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

##### ****How can you implement a custom EqualityComparer to be used within a HashSet or Dictionary for value comparison?****

To implement a custom `EqualityComparer<T>`, you need to create a class that inherits from the `EqualityComparer<T>` base class and overrides the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods. The custom methods should provide the appropriate comparison logic for your specific type.

Here’s an example of a custom `EqualityComparer<Person>`:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public class PersonEqualityComparer : EqualityComparer<Person>
{
    public override bool Equals(Person x, Person y)
    {
        if (x == null && y == null)
            return true;
        if (x == null || y == null)
            return false;

        return x.FirstName == y.FirstName && x.LastName == y.LastName;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode(Person obj)
    {
        if (obj == null)
            return 0;

        int hashFirstName = obj.FirstName == null ? 0 : obj.FirstName.GetHashCode();
        int hashLastName = obj.LastName == null ? 0 : obj.LastName.GetHashCode();

        return hashFirstName ^ hashLastName;
    }
}

var peopleSet = new HashSet<Person>(new PersonEqualityComparer());
var peopleDict = new Dictionary<Person, int>(new PersonEqualityComparer());
```

##### **What is the difference between using GetHashCode for object itself and using EqualityComparer separately?**

**Implementing `GetHashCode`**:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Name.GetHashCode() ^ Age.GetHashCode();
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (obj == null || GetType() != obj.GetType()) return false;
        var otherPerson = (Person)obj;
        return Name == otherPerson.Name && Age == otherPerson.Age;
    }
}

```

**Implementing `EqualityComparer`**:

```csharp
public class PersonEqualityComparer : IEqualityComparer<Person>
{
    public bool Equals(Person x, Person y)
    {
        if (x == null && y == null)
            return true;
        if (x == null || y == null)
            return false;
        return x.Name == y.Name && x.Age == y.Age;
    }

    public int GetHashCode(Person obj)
    {
        return obj.Name.GetHashCode() ^ obj.Age.GetHashCode();
    }
}

```

When to choose one over the other depends on your specific requirements:

- If you want to change both hash code generation and equality comparison for your custom type, implementing `GetHashCode` and `Equals` is a common and straightforward approach.
- If you want to keep the default hash code behavior and comparer for the object but change them for specific use like while using in Hashset and Dictionary, you can create a custom `EqualityComparer` and pass it as a parameter when initializing a `HashSet` or `Dictionary`.

##### ****What are some potential issues with using custom reference types as dictionary keys in C# Collections, and how would you mitigate them?****

When using custom reference types as dictionary keys in C# collections, there are several potential issues that you should be aware of, along with ways to mitigate them:

1. **Inconsistent Hash Codes**: By default, the **`GetHashCode`** method for reference types is based on object identity, meaning that different instances of the same class will produce different hash codes, even if their property values are identical. To mitigate this issue, you should override the **`GetHashCode`** method to generate hash codes based on the content of the object, ensuring that objects with the same content produce the same hash code. This promotes consistent behavior when using objects as keys.
2. **Equality Comparison**: The **`Equals`** method for reference types defaults to reference equality, which means it checks if two objects are the same instance in memory. To correctly compare objects based on their content, you should override the **`Equals`** method to perform content-based comparisons. This is important to ensure that objects with the same content are considered equal when used as keys.
3. **Mutable Keys**: It's generally not recommended to use mutable objects as keys in dictionaries. If you modify a key object after adding it to a dictionary, the object's hash code can change, and the dictionary may not be able to locate the associated value correctly. To mitigate this, consider using immutable objects as keys or ensure that key objects remain constant once they are used as dictionary keys.

##### **What are the performance considerations to take into account when choosing to implement a tree-based collection such as Sorted Set or Sorted Dictionary, and how does its performance compare to a hash-based collection like HashSet or Dictionary?**

When choosing to implement a tree-based collection like `SortedSet<T>` or `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, some performance considerations should be taken into account:

- **Lookup, insertion, and removal operations**: For tree-based collections, operations like lookup, insertion, and removal have an O(log n) time complexity. In comparison, hash-based collections like `HashSet<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` offer, on average, constant-time (O(1)) complexity for these operations. As a result, hash-based collections generally provide faster performance for these operations.
- **Sorting**: Tree-based collections maintain a sorted order, which can be a beneficial feature if you require sorting. In contrast, hash-based collections do not guarantee any specific order and require additional sorting steps when needed.
- **Memory consumption**: Tree-based collections tend to have higher memory consumption than hash-based collections, as tree nodes require storing additional pointers for maintaining the tree structure.

In summary, prefer tree-based collections like `SortedSet<T>` or `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>` when maintaining a sorted order is a priority or a requirement. For general-purpose usage or scenarios where fast lookups, insertions, and removals are more important, consider using hash-based collections like `HashSet<T>` or `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

##### **When to use List vs Hashset?**

When comparing memory consumption between a **`List`** and a **`HashSet`**, it's essential to consider their characteristics and usage patterns:

**List**:

1. **Memory Usage**: A **`List`** typically consumes memory that is proportional to the number of elements it contains. Each element in the list is stored along with additional memory overhead for the list's internal data structures.
2. **Order Preservation**: A **`List`** maintains the order of elements, meaning that the order in which elements are added is preserved. This can be beneficial when order matters but might result in slightly higher memory usage due to maintaining this order.
3. **When to Use**:
    - Use **`List`** when you need a simple, ordered collection to store and manage a list of items.
    - It's suitable for scenarios where you don't require unique keys or fast lookup operations.

**HashSet**:

1. **Memory Usage**: A **`HashSet`** consumes memory based on the number of unique elements it contains. It automatically ensures that there are no duplicate elements, which can lead to lower memory usage compared to a **`List`** with duplicate elements.
2. **Order Preservation**: A **`HashSet`** does not maintain the order of elements. Elements are stored in an unordered manner to optimize for fast membership checks.
3. **When to Use**:
    - Use **`HashSet`** when you need to ensure unique elements and perform fast membership checks.
    - It's ideal for scenarios where you want to quickly determine whether an item is present in the collection.

##### **Discuss the differences between a Stack and a Queue in C# Collections, and provide a real-world example of when each type would be most suitable**

- **Stack**: A Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) collection, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. Main operations in a Stack include `Push` (to add an element to the top) and `Pop` (to remove the top element). : A Stack is suitable for scenarios like managing the Undo and Redo functionality in a text editor or implementing function call stacks in programming languages.
- **Queue**: A Queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) collection, meaning the oldest added element is the first to be removed. Main operations in a Queue include `Enqueue` (to add an element to the end) and `Dequeue` (to remove the front element). : A Queue is suitable for scenarios like handling requests in a server, where each incoming request is queued and processed in the order they were received, or managing print jobs in a printer queue.
